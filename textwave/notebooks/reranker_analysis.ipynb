    "1. Cross-Encoder Only: It demonstrated a much higher relevance score than the TF-IDF, suggesting that the Cross-encoder is much better at undersatnding semantic relationships and producing accurate rankings. It uses a transformer-based deep learning model which can explain for this. Therefore, it is best for tasks that are depending on semantic matching. That being said, it is computationally expensive, so in real world applications with large data, that may be a concern.\n",
    "2. TD-IDF: The limitation is because it focuses primarily on keyword frequency and does not consider semantic meaning, which is why there was a low score. It is better for scenarios where speed and simplicity are more important, but less important in scenarios where semantic matching is key."
